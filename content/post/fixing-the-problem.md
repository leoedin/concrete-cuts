Our buildings are responsible for 40% of carbon emissions. More than cars\[1\]. Far more than planes\[2\]. If we want to stop emitting, this seems like a good place to start.

I’m British, and like many British people I live in an old house. In my case, a brick one built in 1949. It may be 71 years old this year, but for a British house that’s fairly young. In fact, 80% of our housing stock was built more than 60 years ago.

This introduces a problem. Old houses are cold, draughty and poorly insulated. If we’re going to reduce emissions, this needs to be our focus. For every house built to modern standards there’s hundreds more that aren’t. This isn’t just a British problem. It’s worldwide.

The technology is all there. You can insulate your cavity walls, under your floors, put insulation in your loft…. \[ More things\]

But it’s not enough. Most houses are still cold, draughty and poorly insulated.

This website is about fixing our cold and draughty houses.
